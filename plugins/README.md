# React-WP plugins

Put bundled React-WP plugins in this directory. Each plugin should have its own
folder and a `manifest.json` file.

Example:

```text
plugins/
  my-plugin/
    manifest.json
    index.tsx
```

Example manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "vendor-my-plugin",
  "name": "My Plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Vendor",
  "description": "A React-WP extension.",
  "entry": "./index.tsx"
}
```

Vite automatically discovers plugin `index.tsx` files one level below this
directory at build time. It does not execute arbitrary files discovered at
runtime. A plugin folder becomes available after the next build.

## Test plugin

The `sample-rwp-plugin` folder is a working example. It registers an admin
page, a dashboard widget, and a site-title filter. It is discovered by the
Vite plugin glob in `src/main.jsx`.

During development, run `npm run dev` and use `http://localhost:5173`. Plugin
modules include HMR cleanup so edits replace the previous plugin instance and
remove old styles, hooks, pages, and widgets. Port 3000 serves the production
build and only changes after `npm run build` and a server restart.
